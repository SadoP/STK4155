This repository completes [the report](https://github.uio.no/Pascalsa/FYS4155/blob/master/FYS-STK4155-Project1-Pascal_Sado.pdf) for the [second assignment](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/Projects/2020/Project2/html/Project2.html) in FYS-STK4155.  
Running the main.py script should take a few minutes and creates the figures and results which are used in the report.  
For every task there is a function that starts the calculation / creation of figures corresponding to the task, the basic functions that do the calculations for each task are the same and kept as general as possible to make it easier to follow the code and reuse them at a later stage.
The outputs are either printed to the command line and referenced in the report or are images which are placed in a subfolder for each task in the "image" folder.
